# Lightweight reactivity for Unity

## Installation

  * Via .unitypackage file:

    Download package from [releases page](https://github.com/laphedhendad/com.laphed.reactivity/releases).
    Add to project with Assets/Import Package/Custom Package...
    
  * Via git URL:

    Open Window/Package Manager and choose +/Add package from git URL...
    
    Set `https://github.com/laphedhendad/com.laphed.reactivity.git` as URL.

    If you want to set a target version, UI Framework uses the \*.\*.\* release tag so you can specify a version like #1.0.0. For example `https://github.com/laphedhendad/com.laphed.reactivity.git#1.0.0`.
